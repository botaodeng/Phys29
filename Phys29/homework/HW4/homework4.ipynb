    "## Problem 1: Benford's Law\n",
    "Benford's law refers to the observation that in many real-life datasets, the frequency of the first digits of each number is not uniform. \n",
    "If the digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur as the first digit with equal probability, i.e. 1/9 per digit, or 11.1% of the time. \n",
    "Instead, there tend to be many more numbers with the  first significant (decimal) digit of 1 as compared to 9. This applies best to datsets where \n",
    "the numbers span several orders of magnitude.  Familiarize yourself with Benford's law by reading the Wikipedia page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law). \n",
    "Incidentally, Benfordâ€™s law is used in forensic accounting to detect fraud, see [here](https://www.acfeinsights.com/acfe-insights/what-is-benfords-law). \n",

    "Download the file [census_data.csv](https://github.com/enigma-igm/Phys29/blob/main/Phys29/homework/HW4/data/census_data.csv) at this link: https://github.com/enigma-igm/Phys29/blob/main/Phys29/homework/HW4/data/census_data.csv This is a comma-separated values or **csv** file containing data from the United States Census Bureau. It lists the number of inhabitants for every town in the USA. As we discussed in the Week4 [lecture](https://github.com/enigma-igm/Phys29/tree/main/Phys29/lectures/Week4) on Reading and Writing Files, a CSV file is like a simple spreadsheet, where cells in each row are separated by a specific delimiter (in this case, a comma). As is indicated in the first header line of the CSV, the census data has three columns: State,Town,Population. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that Problem 2 will require you to reuse some of the code that you develop for this problem. Make sure that you write general functions for this problem that you can then use for both problems.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** Write a Python program to read the census data file using the `pandas` package. \n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Extract the most significant digit from the Population column data for each town. For example for `California,Santa Barbara city,86353`, the most significant digit of the Population is 8. Store the most significant digits for each town in a `numpy` array.  This array should have integer type and shape `shape=(ntown,)` where `ntown` is the number of towns in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** Construct a numpy array of shape `(9,)` that contains the integer number of times that each of the most significant digits 1-9 appears in the dataset. For this part of the problem, you are allowed to loop over the numbers (1,2,...9), **but no other loops are allowed!!, i.e. you cannot loop over the towns in the dataset** Hint: Use `numpy` Boolean indexing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**d)** Write a program to plot a histogram of the **number of times** that each significant digit appears. The $x$-axis should be the digits (1,2,...9), and the $y$-axis should be the number of times that each digit appears. Plot the expectation for the case where the distribution across the digits is uniform, i.e. 11.1% per digit, as a horizontal line on the same plot. I realize we have not covered plotting yet in the lectures, but you can use Google or AI to assist you. \n",

    "\n",
    "**f)** Do the populations in this dataset obey Benford's law? Explain your reasoning. \n",
    "\n",
    "**g)** Make a histogram of the town Populations using the following code:\n",

    "from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n",

    "plt.xlabel('Population')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Number of Towns')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that we have chosen our histogram bins to be linearly spaced in the $\\log_{10}$ of the population and made our histogram plot with a log scale on the $x$-axis to better illustrate the full dynamic range of the populations. We similarly chose a log scale on the $y$-axis to illustrate the large range of the number of cities in each histogram bin.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the *distribution* of populations illustrated by the histogram, comment on why or why not you would expect the population data to obey Benford's law. \n"

The dates are represented by a floating point number where the integer part is the year and the decimal part is the fraction of the year. In other words,  1995.75 would be three quarters into the year 1995, or 10/01/1995.  The average temperatures are in degrees Celsius. \n",
