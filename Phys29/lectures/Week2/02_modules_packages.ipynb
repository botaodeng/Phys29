It also has a number of useful mathematical constants, i.e. I used ```np.pi``` in the example above to access the constant $\\pi$. \n",

    "I also imported the ```scipy``` module so that I could access the Bessel functions in the ```scipy.special``` sub-module. In other words the ```scipy``` package is actually a collection of ```.py``` files arranged in a directory hierarchy, and so you can think of ```scipy.special``` as being the path to a file in that directory structure.  Finally, I used the statement ```import matplotlib.pyplot as plt``` to import the ```pyplot``` function (abbreviated as ```plt``` as is the standard) from the ```matplotlib.pyplot``` sub-module. \n",
